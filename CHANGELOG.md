# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this
project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- The README's imagery is rendered rather than screen-captured, and its generator lives
  in [`tools/demo`](tools/demo): a menu bar banner that shows the floating bar in place,
  and a walkthrough animation covering selection, hiding, revealing, the per-icon context
  menu and restoring. Both are reproducible from the repo.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-24

First public release.

### Added

- Group menu bar icons by app and move any of them into a hidden area.
- A floating bar, drawn below the menu bar, that reveals the hidden apps' icons;
  click one to switch to it, right-click for per-app actions.
- Per-app context menu with Open, Preferences, Restore to menu bar, Hide, Reveal in
  Finder, Quit and Force Quit.
- Global shortcuts that work even when the menu bar icon is hidden:
  `⌥⌘M` toggles the floating bar, `⌥⌘\` toggles the menu bar icons.
- Optional "hide on launch".
- Localization: English and Simplified Chinese, selected automatically from the
  macOS language setting, with a manual override in the main window.
- Built-in verification that hiding really took effect, reported in the window.
- Universal binary (Apple Silicon and Intel), packaged as a `.dmg`.
